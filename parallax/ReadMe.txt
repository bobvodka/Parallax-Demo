   The Parallax Project
========================================================================

It was 3am... I was bored... this project was born to kill sometime
and let me avoid doing any real work for a while... 

Practically all the code is mine, do with as you feel, the only 
expections are;

AngelCode's BMFGen font support code;
The parser and struct are from a forum post Promit did a while back
http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=330742

Sound system is by BASS; www.un4seen.com
Because Fmod would have been overkill....

The Maths folder, this was taken from Game Programming Gems because
I didn't want to write my own :D

Thanks to Craig aka Wisey for being a test guinue pig for the final 
version of the code :D

later,
Rob / Phantom
